# Find Square Root Floor Value

- Find the square root of the integer without using any Python library. You have to find the floor value of the square root.

- For example if the given number is 16, then the answer would be 4.

- If the given number is 27, the answer would be 5 because sqrt(5) = 5.196 whose floor value is 5.

- The expected time complexity is O(log(n))


# How to use it

- Run `./main.py` what will execute the test cases in `./tests` and a demo
